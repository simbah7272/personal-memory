Parse the following text into a leisure record. Extract activity, duration, enjoyment score, notes, and date.

Text: {text}

IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with a raw JSON object. Do NOT wrap it in markdown code blocks. Do NOT add any explanatory text. The response must start with "{{" and end with "}}".

Required JSON format (exactly match this structure):
{{
  "activity": "name of the leisure activity",
  "duration_hours": number (e.g., 2.0),
  "enjoyment_score": number from 1 to 5 (or null if not mentioned),
  "notes": "any additional details (or null)",
  "record_date": "YYYY-MM-DD (use today if not specified: {today})"
}}

Rules:
- Extract the main activity as the activity name
- Duration should be in hours as a decimal number
- Enjoyment score: 1=很不喜欢, 2=不喜欢, 3=一般, 4=喜欢, 5=非常喜欢
- If enjoyment is not explicitly mentioned, try to infer from language or use null
- Include any additional details in notes
